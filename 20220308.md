# Putin’s ‘Vertical’ Empire Will Fall

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin) obviously didn’t get the memo. The **kleptocrat** **handbook** has changed. You don’t invade countries anymore because after the smoke clears, you have to fix their **plumbing** and heating and cell service. Instead, you hire them.

Some **estimate** Mr. Putin may be worth $100 billion via hidden **holdings** in [Gazprom](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OGZPY), Russia’s state-owned energy company. But [Jeff Bezos](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jeff-bezos) and Bill Gates are worth more and they don’t control any tanks. Their success shows the world is now divided into **horizontal** slices, with the most productive sitting on top. The American empire, if you want to call it that, is a horizontal empire. Mr. Putin’s attempt to re-create the Soviet Union’s **vertical** empire is **doomed** to fail.

As digitization allowed design and control to be separated from manufacturing, the world got horizontal, organizing into **stacks** of companies, industries and even countries to which markets provide **capital** based on their value-add.

[IBM](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) **vertically** **integrated** computers, while [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT), [Intel](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/INTC), Dell, Singapore-made disk drives and Japanese memory chips **dominated** slices of the personal-computing stack. [AT&T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) was vertical, the Internet horizontal, with Google and [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) sitting on top of the data-center, **fiber-optics** and **cable-modem** slices. [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) adds its operating system to smartphones after paying [Foxconn](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TW/XTAI/2317) to **assemble** Korean screens and Taiwanese chips in China. Successful companies give up owning everything to expand opportunities.

As long as the U.S. provides the stuff at the top, its horizontal empire will **endure**, creating societal wealth and enough technology and taxes to defend itself and its allies. These include Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, all of which have far higher **gross** **domestic** product per **capita** than vertical **commodity**-dominated Russia. Especially in trade, horizontal **topples** vertical.

Under the **guise** of reuniting the Soviet Union’s footprint, Mr. Putin wants to control oil and gas **distribution** to **clueless** nuclear-reducing, wind-dependent, **energy-deprived** European countries. Control Ukraine and he might prevent others from delivering fuel.

This game is 150 years old. John D. Rockefeller played it in the 1870s, **colluding** with railroads to control the transport of oil, building pipelines to **bypass** competitors like the Pennsylvania Railroad, and **allegedly** destroying competing pipelines. It worked then, but it won’t in 2022. The U.S. can ship **liquefied** natural gas to Europe from its **fracking** fields.

Today’s wealth and power seekers hire what they need lower down the stack. I know plenty of startups with software-development teams in Ukraine. Estonia, Poland, Romania and India have teams of coders for hire. Countries start lower down the stack until enough talent and capital are accumulated to **implement** creative ideas on their own. See Israel—and China.

It’s a shame Mr. Putin has **petroleum**-fogged vision. Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon all have market caps greater than Russia’s GDP. Russia has, or had anyway, a **vibrant** software community, including VKontakte, its own social network. But scale matters, and property rights for Russian entrepreneurs feel **fickle**.

Mr. Putin could have encouraged **entrepreneurs** or at least noted that oil and gas will eventually decline in importance and funded research into batteries and nuclear and **geothermal** energy. Instead, he **unimaginatively** invaded. The horizontal world has more power than Mr. Putin realized. Many Russian banks were cut off from the Swift interbank messaging system. Russia’s central bank has been isolated and raised interest rates to protect a crashing ruble and closed its stock exchange. Reminder: It was also closed in 1917-92.

China has smartly allowed **capitalism** to bring hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. The Chinese Communist Party stayed in power while a market economy grew, but recently the party has felt threatened by those pulling the technology **levers**. [Alibaba](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BABA)’s Jack Ma was silenced, tutors shut down, videogames limited. The party took control of data access. China is foolishly going vertical, threatening its honey pot.

I can hear the **criticism** now: “A horizontal model **exploits** those in the lower slices.” But it doesn’t—just the opposite. The horizontal model grows economies and raises the standard of living of everyone in the stack, with a **byproduct**: They can afford to buy more of America’s stuff like iPhones, virtual-reality **goggles**, HBO subscriptions and NBA streams. Grow the pie, unlike an **oligarchy** that only **shuffles** wealth around.

Xi Jinping and the Communist Party have their eyes on Taiwan and its world-leading chip manufacturing. Is an invasion **imminent**? It’s less likely. Mr. Xi must now see what it’s like to be “Putined”—**excluded** from the global financial system. It’s not worth it. Let’s make Mr. Putin the last to play this old game.

**Commodities** come and go, while productivity drives progress. Horizontal rules. This will be true in the future for cloud computing, machine learning and autonomous vehicles. But staying on top requires constant innovation. Despite all the talent in Russia, Mr. Putin never understood this. I’m not always convinced U.S. leadership does either.



# Russia **Pummels** Civilian Targets While Talks Make Scant Progress

LVIV, Ukraine—Ukrainian and Russian **negotiators** [ended a third round of talks](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-07?mod=article_inline) Monday with little progress, while [Ukraine’s military held fast](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-russia-war-invasion-whats-happening-11646157211?mod=article_inline) along several fronts and Russia continued to shell cities and residential areas.

Continuing campaigns to encircle Ukrainian cities, Russian forces conducted missile and rocket strikes on cities and military targets in the country’s north and south, disrupting plans to [evacuate civilians](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-artillery-kills-ukrainian-civilians-fleeing-kyiv-suburb-11646575238?mod=article_inline) via humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian officials said. [Ukrainian forces](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-advance-is-blunted-by-ukrainian-tactics-war-tested-troops-and-western-weapons-11646575579?mod=article_inline) continued to **frustrate** Russia with counterattacks and **sabotage** operations.

#### [READ LIVE UPDATES ON RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news)

In the 12 days since the start of the invasion, [Russia’s failure to capture major cities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-military-chief-promised-quick-victory-in-ukraine-but-now-faces-a-potential-quagmire-11646582366?mod=article_inline) and its mounting loss of aircraft and armored vehicles have increased pressure on Moscow in a war that has drawn global [condemnation and sanctions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanctions-will-hurt-russia-but-are-unlikely-to-deter-its-aggression-in-ukraine-11646314400?mod=article_inline).

In a third round of talks, held in neighboring Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said his team and their Russian **counterparts** agreed on some **logistical** workings to help people trapped in the fighting after earlier agreements to allow civilians to flee **collapsed**.

“We will receive more effective assistance to people who are currently suffering from Russian aggression,” Mikhail Podolyak, a Ukrainian negotiator and **presidential** **aide**, said on Twitter, without providing details.

Russia Hits Civilian Evacuation Route as Ukrainians Protest OccupationPlay video: Russia Hits Civilian Evacuation Route as Ukrainians Protest Occupation

Mr. Podolyak said that negotiators, however, achieved little else though agreed to continue **consultations** to reach a cease-fire. The assessment was shared by a Russian negotiator, who said his side wasn’t satisfied with the outcome.

“It has not been going easy and it’s too soon to talk of something positive,” Russia’s lead negotiator and Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky was quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying.

Foreign ministers of both countries are set to meet on Thursday in a Turkish resort city, Turkey said.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who has spoken with Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin) several times during the crisis, including on Sunday, expressed **pessimism** about talks in the near term.

“I do not think that in the days and weeks to come, there will be a real negotiated solution,” he said at a campaign event in France. “Discussions with President Putin are difficult because today he **refuses** a cease-fire.”

Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, [whose government has supported Russia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-russia-xi-putin-ukraine-war-11646279098?mod=article_inline) while also calling for negotiations, said Beijing would work with the international community to provide “necessary **mediation**” when required.

With Ukraine’s ability to **withstand** the barrage amid increasing shortages of food, medicine and other supplies in question, President Volodymyr Zelensky, in separate calls with President Biden, U.K. Prime Minister [Boris Johnson](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/boris-johnson) and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, pressed his case for increased sanctions against Russia and the **implementation** of a no-fly zone over his country.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has [rejected requests](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-nato-reject-intervening-in-ukraine-11646428978?mod=article_inline) for a no-fly zone, saying it would risk war with Russia—an outcome that Mr. Putin has threatened if any NATO members [enter the conflict](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blinken-says-nato-considering-more-permanent-troops-in-baltics-11646658623?mod=article_inline).

In a media briefing Monday, Mr. Zelensky called for a new package of sanctions and an **embargo** on Russian oil. “You can call this an embargo,” he said. “Or you can call this just morality, when you refuse to give money to a terrorist. Let the war feed them.”

The White House said an embargo was under consideration, [causing oil prices to soar](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-industry-contemplates-world-without-russian-crude-11646662344?mod=article_inline) above  135 a barrel on global markets before falling to just above $124. Mr. Biden and the leaders of France, Germany and the U.K. in a call “**affirmed** their determination to continue raising the costs on Russia” for invading Ukraine, the White House said.

Separately, Mr. Johnson said that a total oil embargo on Russia wasn’t **feasible**. “We can’t simply close down the use of oil and gas overnight,” he said in **remarks** to reporters in London. Instead he said European nations would work to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

Mr. Putin spoke Monday with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, **asserting**—contrary to evidence of deadly Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine—that the Russian military was taking steps to save civilian lives, and accusing Kyiv of obstructing those efforts, according to the Kremlin’s account of the phone call.

In an interview Monday with ABC News, Mr. Zelensky suggested that the question of whether Mr. Putin [is deliberately targeting civilians](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-07/card/zelensky-asks-americans-for-help-fighter-jets-in-abc-interview-i5Yhmrr0nvczRj4FtxxB?mod=article_inline) is irrelevant: “Why would I care? The result is the same.”

Roughly [1.7 million people have fled Ukraine,](https://twitter.com/Refugees/status/1501003275541356556?s=20&t=cdFuV1wgRdSGBXz2ZqXPZQ) mostly women and children, the U.N.’s refugee agency said on Twitter Monday.

Outside Kyiv, Russian forces shot and killed Yuri Prylypko, the mayor of Hostomel, and two people who were helping him distribute food and medicine, according to the local government’s Facebook page. Hostomel was the [site of fierce fighting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-thought-ukraine-would-fall-quickly-an-airport-battle-proved-him-wrong-11646343121?mod=article_inline) in the war’s early days.

In Kharkiv, near the Russian border, Russia **intensified** attacks on civilian targets, pressing to **subdue** a city, Ukraine’s second largest, that remains in Ukrainian control after days of fierce bombardment.

Russia’s concentrated strikes on civilian sites overnight in Kharkiv killed eight people and set more than 20 buildings **ablaze**, emergency services said. A Ukrainian counteroffensive retook a town on the **outskirts** of the city, with Ukrainian officials saying two Russian **colonels** were killed in the operation.

Kharkiv’s national police office said Monday that 209 people, including 133 civilians, had died so far in the attacks since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24.

A school in the northern city of Chernihiv was destroyed in shelling overnight, Ukraine’s emergency service said, while regional officials in Vinnytsia, a city to the south, raised the death toll from a Sunday **cruise** missile attack to nine, including five civilians.

Elsewhere, Russia has been **consolidating** gains. In Irpin, to Kyiv’s west, where residents have been [without food and water](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-food-medicine-shortages-trigger-global-response-11646410820?mod=article_inline) for three days, Russia moved in tanks and motorized infantry units in a sign of what may be in store for the capital. Ukraine’s government said 2,000 civilians were safely evacuated from Irpin on Monday.



Russia continued efforts to **subdue** cities and towns in the Ukrainian south, **piecing** together a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula and choking off Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov Seas.

Russian forces have nearly **encircled** the Azov Sea port city of Mariupol, trapping civilians. Aid group Doctors Without Borders described the humanitarian situation in the city as **catastrophic**. In the nearby city of Melitopol, Russian forces took the main TV and radio tower, the city’s mayor said.

With food supplies threatened across the country, Ukraine banned exports of **staples** such as **rye**, **oats**, **buckwheat**, salt and sugar.

During the night, Russia **assaulted** an airport outside the southern port city of Mykolaiv, using Smerch multiple-rocket launchers to pound civilian targets.

Kyiv said Ukrainian forces had destroyed 30 Russian helicopters at an airfield near Kherson, a Russian-occupied city in southern Ukraine.

Missiles launched from Russian ships in the Black Sea struck infrastructure in Tuzla, south of the port city of Odessa, which Mr. Zelensky said is the target of a Russian offensive, according to plans he said Ukraine has obtained. Russian ships were regrouping on the Black Sea, according to a Ukrainian official in Odessa.

“We know that Russian troops are actively preparing to attack Odessa,” said Mr. Podolyak. “They have already tried to **implement** this plan. But our defense has managed to hold them back.”

A Ukrainian official in Odessa said Monday Ukrainian forces struck a Russian **vessel** in the Black Sea. Images on social media appeared to confirm the strike.

Ukrainian railways scheduled an additional evacuation train out of Odessa for Monday.

In the country’s east, Ukraine blunted a Russian advance in the Luhansk region, trading artillery blasts and killing nearly 40 soldiers and hitting an oil **depot**, Ukrainian Interfax news service reported.

Also Monday, the Kremlin announced a list of what it called unfriendly countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Micronesia and Singapore. A Russian government plane left New York carrying a dozen United Nations diplomats that the U.S. last week ordered **expelled**.

Ukraine continued to **muster** international support. The United Arab Emirates said it had flown 30 tons of aid and medical supplies to Poland Monday for ground transport to Ukraine.

The U.K. announced a $100 million grant to help pay Ukrainian pensions and public-sector salaries, and the U.S., with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. called on Interpol to **suspend** Russian membership.

“We decide the future of the continent with our resistance and our friends decid

 it with their help,” Mr. Zelensky said.
