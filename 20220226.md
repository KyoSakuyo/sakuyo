# Biden Asks Congress for $6.4 Billion in Additional Funding for Ukraine Conflict

The Biden administration has asked **Congress** for $6.4 billion in additional funding for needs related to the invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The additional funds would be distributed to the State Department, the Department of Defense and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The request was made in a briefing to **appropriation** committees and leadership Friday, and was expected to be folded into the annual government spending bill currently being negotiated on the Hill.

The additional funds would support humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine and Central European partners, said an Office of Management and Budget official.

The request could grow or change as the situation on the ground **evolves**, officials said. But for now, it includes 3.5 billion for the Department of Defense and $2.9 billion for the State Department and USAID for U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, and other allies.

# Russia Blocks U.N. Bid to End Ukraine Conflict; China Abstains From Vote

Russia voted against a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, but China abstained from the vote, showing that no country on the council was willing to side completely with Moscow.

The resolution condemned Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine as a violation of the U.N. **Charter** and would have required Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine immediately.

Eleven countries represented on the council voted in favor of the resolution Friday, while China, India and the United Arab Emirates **abstained** from the vote. Some **diplomats** had worried that Beijing would vote “no”  **alongside** Russia and Western officials viewed the outcome as good because it showed Moscow's relative isolation.

India, a longtime defense partner of Russia, has remained **ambivalent** in the conflict, calling for dialogue and declining to **criticize** Moscow.

Moscow is **presiding** over the U.N. Security Council this month and has a permanent seat on the council, giving it a veto over any binding resolutions.“

Russia as a party [to the conflict] should have abstained from voting on this resolution,” said Mona Juul, Norway’s ambassador.

The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said there is no middle ground when one country is invading another.

Russia will likely face a vote on a nonbinding resolution at the broader U.N. General Assembly in coming weeks, officials say.



# How the West Misread Vladimir Putin

Western powers and their allies [have lined up to oppose](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-to-cut-70-of-russias-banking-system-off-from-global-markets-11645760548?mod=article_inline) Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-capital-rocked-by-explosions-as-russia-intensifies-attack-11645771768?mod=article_inline). They can’t say he didn’t warn them.

Fifteen years ago, the former KGB officer **railed** against U.S. **domination** of global affairs and [**assailed** the post-Cold War security order](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-crisis-kicks-off-new-superpower-struggle-among-u-s-russia-and-china-11645629753?mod=article_inline) as a threat to his country. In the years that followed, he **grabbed** **portions** of Georgia, annexed Crimea and [sent troops in Ukraine’s Donbas region](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-sanctions-11645819467?mod=article_inline).

Mr. Putin sent repeated signals that he [intended to widen Russia’s **sphere** of influence](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-invasion-is-putins-boldest-move-yet-to-restore-russias-place-in-the-world-11645731030?mod=article_inline) and cast the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastward expansion as an **existential** threat to Moscow’s security. He made plain he viewed Ukraine as part of Russia.

Yet until recently few Western leaders imagined [Mr. Putin would go through with a full-scale invasion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-putin-invade-explained-11645570205?mod=article_inline), having miscalculated his determination to use force—on a scale that recalls the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968—to restore Russian control over the nations on its **periphery**.

Russian forces moved by air and land to attack Kyiv on Friday after launching an invasion Wednesday. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Russia was ready for negotiations, but the goals of its combat operation to “demilitarize” Ukraine remained.

“It was strategic narcissism and an associated failure to consider the emotion, ideology, and aspiration that drives Putin and the Siloviki around him,” said H.R. McMaster, the retired three-star Army general who served as former U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump)’s national security adviser, referring to the small circle of hard-line advisers around the Russian president.

Mr. Putin’s all-out assault on Ukraine has put the West on its back foot, where it is now struggling to find ways to deter the Kremlin’s aggression and to influence a Russian leader who has openly expressed disdain for the West and called into doubt its willingness to take decisive action.

The costs of the West’s failure to **deter** Russia is now being **borne** by Ukraine, which for 14 years has existed in a **strategic** **purgatory**: marked for potential membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but never admitted into the alliance and the security guarantees that it provided.

Longer term, the invasion has **ruptured** the already **chilly** relations between the Western alliance and Moscow.

When Mr. Putin’s forces invaded Georgia in 2008 after it was promised eventual NATO membership, and recognized two breakaway areas, the West reacted by temporarily **suspending** dialogue, before returning to business as usual. **Sanctions** **imposed** after Russia’s **annexation** of Crimea in 2014 also didn’t bite.

In recent months, senior U.S. officials have laid out Mr. Putin’s invasion plans. The misreading of Mr. Putin, however, cuts across multiple U.S. administrations.

Former President George W. Bush said he had looked into Mr. Putin’s eyes and found him **trustworthy**. Former President Barack Obama dismissed Mr. Putin’s Russia as a “**regional** power” threatening its neighbors out of weakness. Former President Donald Trump saw the U.S.’s European allies, and their **reluctance** to assume more of the burden for defense, as a bigger problem than putting the Kremlin on notice. President Biden sought to build a “stable, predictable” relationship with Mr. Putin with a **summit** meeting in June.

The attack exposes **complacency** in Europe, which allowed its military to shrink and did little to reduce its energy dependency on Russia, despite Moscow’s increasingly aggressive behavior, which included cyberattacks on Western targets. Even as the West imposes sanctions on Russia, it is sending hundreds of millions of dollars daily to pay for Russian gas.

Western leaders took comfort in the limited nature of Mr. Putin’s earlier military **interventions**. Those were considered **deniable**, smaller-scale operations that sought to mask the extent of Russia’s role. Russian actions also included hacks on the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and cyber attacks on its neighbors. The U.S. and its allies neither **marshaled** the military and economic **leverage** to **forestall** his invasion of Ukraine nor presented a major **diplomatic** **concession**, such as **halting** NATO expansion.

“The West did not **underestimate** Russia’s military capabilities. It watched the determined military **modernization** program since the Georgian war in 2008, and saw some of its fruits in the militarily successful intervention in Syria in 2015,” said William Courtney, the former U.S. ambassador to Georgia and Kazakhstan during the Clinton administration. “But the West may have underestimated the Kremlin’s willingness to use force in Europe, and against a people which Putin claims are one with Russians.”

Mr. Putin’s early cooperation with the West **morphed** into **animosity** over his two decades in power. The Russia he **inherited** had a broken **bureaucracy** and an economy the size of Belgium. Now he oversees a government and military fueled by years of high energy prices.

When Mr. Putin became president in 1999, he cut a very different figure from his **predecessor**, Boris Yelstin. Mr. Yeltsin had a **jovial**, **backslapping** relationship in public with former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Putin was a closed book.

By the time Mr. Putin came to power—via the KGB and local politics in his native Saint Petersburg—Russia was inside the Group of Eight and was being consulted by NATO although staying outside the alliance.

In his early exchanges with Western leaders and new on the international scene, Mr. Putin appeared respectful.

Mr. Bush attempted to build a personal relationship with him. In their first meeting at a summit in Slovenia in June 2001, Mr. Bush said: “I looked the man in the eye and found him very straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul. He’s a man who’s deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Putin was the first foreign leader to call Mr. Bush to offer **condolences** and cooperation in fighting terrorism.

He offered intelligence and logistical support to the U.S. as it invaded Afghanistan, over the heads of some in Russia’s military **establishment**. Michael McFaul, who would later become an adviser to the Obama administration at the time praised the relationship as “another chance to really end the Cold War.”

Thomas Graham, the senior National Security Council official for Russia affairs in the Bush administration, said that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was the first of several events that Mr. Putin would have objected to if Russia **carried more sway.**





“Putin didn’t believe in these things but didn’t **see much point** in opposing them because the West was going to do them anyway,” Mr. Graham said. “He told people that he was not going to oppose them publicly because it would just make him look bad.”

Mr. Putin’s **suspicions** toward the West became more pronounced with the so-called colored revolutions beginning in 2004 that **toppled** leaders of former Soviet states, and later with the Arab Spring.

NATO had meanwhile continued its expansion to Eastern European countries that had been in the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact in 1999 and then in 2004, when the alliance was also enlarged to cover the three Baltic states that had been part of the Soviet Union. The U.S. and its allies saw enlargement as a way to encourage reform in the newly emerging democracies. NATO’s new members were looking to sit under the U.S. security umbrella should Russia threaten to absorb them again.



Mr. Putin’s anger over enlargement became clear in a speech he made at the annual Munich Security Conference in 2007, where he surprised his audience as he **railed** against the **unipolar** world dominated by the U.S. There he laid out his **grievances** against NATO expansion, **leveling** **allegations** of broken promises from the West that NATO wouldn’t shift eastward and **depicting** enlargement as a threat to Russia.

Enlargement “represents a serious **provocation** that reduces the level of **mutual** trust. And we have the right to ask: Against whom is this expansion intended?” he said.

Tensions **ratcheted** up further a year later. Mr. Putin was invited to a NATO summit in Bucharest, where leaders were discussing a route into the alliance for Georgia and Ukraine. While Mr. Bush wanted the countries to be admitted in short order, France and Germany opposed the move.

In the end, a compromise allowed Georgia and Ukraine to eventually be admitted but with no date set.

The outcome turned out to be the worst of both worlds for the two countries. Hard-liners in Moscow had identified them as potential future **adversaries**—but ones that weren’t yet protected by the alliance’s security guarantees. “They got the hot breath of Russia on their necks while they didn’t get NATO membership,” said Jamie Shea, a senior NATO official at the time.

While in Bucharest, in a meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Putin told him that Ukraine wasn’t a real country, according to Western officials.

In August that year, Mr. Putin invaded Georgia, routing a U.S.-trained Georgian military. Western experts say the Russia learned from the military **mishaps** in that **incursion** and **subsequently** upgraded its equipment and shifted toward a professional, rather than a **conscript**, army.

When Mr. Obama visited Russia in 2009, he met Mr. Putin at his **dacha**. There, according to a **memoir** by the U.S. president, he received an “animated and seemingly endless **monologue**” on the **slights** Mr. Putin felt the U.S. had made, including expanding NATO and invading Iraq.

After Russian forces seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Mr. Obama dismissed the development as the actions of a “regional power that is threatening some of its immediate neighbors, not out of strength but out of weakness.” The following year, after Russian forces intervened in Syria on President Bashar al-Assad’s behalf, U.S. officials played down the significance, saying it might even lead to a Russian **quagmire**.

**Successive** U.S. presidents sought to keep the possibility for cooperation amid the differences. Mr. Shea, the former NATO official, said in **retrospect** that the West should have acted earlier and more firmly.

“We should have **imposed** in my opinion the sanctions on Russia that we are imposing today either in 2008 or 2014, because then Putin might have got the message that the West would react **vigorously** and might have been **deterred**,” Mr. Shea said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, days before Russia launched war on his country, **likened** the West’s posture toward Russia to the mistakes of **appeasement** in the 20th century. He criticized Western nations for not imposing sanctions earlier. “What are you waiting for?” he said. “We don’t need sanctions after the **bombardment** begins.”
