## Ukraine’s Zelensky Calls for More Military Aid Ahead of Battles in Eastern Regions

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launched a fresh appeal for military aid as the country prepares for what are expected to become [the war’s biggest battles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-russia-send-reinforcements-for-pitched-battles-in-conflicts-next-phase-11649588496?mod=article_inline) in eastern Ukraine, while refugees continued to flee westward to escape an expanding war zone.

In a virtual address to lawmakers in South Korea on Monday, Mr. Zelensky [asked for military equipment](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-11/card/zelensky-requests-weapons-from-south-korea-n80kSErcIdnbbZNC6eg9?mod=article_inline), pressing the country to deliver more than the humanitarian assistance and **nonlethal** aid it has given so far. “We thank South Korea for the help you have provided, but in order to survive from [the war with Russia](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news) we need more help,” Mr. Zelensky said during the roughly 15-minute address.

Ukraine has stepped up its **pleas** for heavy military equipment to fight the **conventional** tank and artillery battles that are expected in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia are moving troops and materiel into the region. Ukrainian combat units from areas of northern Ukraine that it recovered following a Russian withdrawal there have started moving toward Donbas.

Russia’s main objective now is to seize the parts of Donbas not yet controlled by Moscow. **Skirmishes** along the contact line in Donbas and nearby regions continue daily, with Russian forces trying to push south of Izyum. The timing of a major campaign, Western and Ukrainian officials said, is up to Moscow, which may press the offensive imminently with available forces, or wait a few weeks to **reconstitute** units that suffered losses in northern Ukraine.

The Russian Defense **Ministry** said Monday that air-based missiles destroyed a weapons and military equipment repair base of the Ukrainian air-defense forces overnight, as well as two **ammunition** depots. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that the strikes targeted a repair base near Velyka Novosilka in the Donetsk region, and that the ammunition depots near Mykolayiv, in southern Ukraine, and Zhovtneve, west of Kharkiv in Ukraine’s northeast, were also destroyed. Those claims couldn’t be independently verified.

Gen. Konashenkov also said that Kalibr missiles on Sunday had destroyed parts of an S-300 antiaircraft missile system that was supplied to Ukraine “by a European country.”

That claim was **denied** by Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger, whose government last week said it had [delivered an S-300 to Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-08/card/slovakia-delivers-soviet-designed-s-300-air-defense-system-to-ukraine-wLmJLguxLDQO4k28cKwR?mod=article_inline). The S-300 is one of many kinds of advanced weaponry that Ukraine has been urging its Western allies to deliver and would be effective against military aircraft and short-range **ballistic** missiles.

In Moscow, **Austrian** **Chancellor** Karl Nehammer was expected to meet with Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin), marking the first time a leader from a European Union country has visited since the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine.

The trip comes a day after Mr. Nehammer met with Mr. Zelensky in Kyiv at the weekend. The Austrian chancellor has faced criticism at home for [his Moscow trip](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-11/card/austrian-chancellor-becomes-first-western-leader-to-visit-vladimir-putin-since-invasion-of-ukraine-E0NOnAZjggEmwEL6W3aN?mod=article_inline) as it comes just a week after reports first appeared about **atrocities** **allegedly** committed by Russian troops against civilians during their occupation of the Kyiv region.

Mr. Nehammer said the trip was a “risky mission” but that **diplomacy** was now needed to end **hostilities**. “Everything that can be done to help the people of Ukraine and stop the war must be done,” he told reporters Sunday.

Austria has traditionally close ties with Russia but has condemned alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

Austrian officials said that the trip was **coordinated** with the leaders of EU **institutions**, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hosted recent Russia-Ukraine peace talks, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

More Western companies announced sales or suspensions of their Russian operations on Monday in the wake of sanctions imposed by the European Union and the U.S.

French [bank Société Générale](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SCGLY) SA said it would **cease** its banking and insurance activities in Russia, including selling Rosbank, while Swedish **telecommunications** company [Ericsson](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ERIC) AB said Monday that it was [suspending its business](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-11/card/ericsson-suspends-russia-business-indefinitely-books-95-million-provision-LnEZdToGzHIidgizVZhE?mod=article_inline) in Russia indefinitely.

Société Générale said it was [selling its entire **stake**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/societe-generale-sells-russian-bank-to-oligarch-vladimir-potanin-11649670434?mod=article_inline) in Rosbank and its Russian insurance units to Interros, a **conglomerate** controlled by metals billionaire Vladimir Potanin.

The war is having a **devastating** economic impact on Ukraine. The World Bank said the country’s economy is [expected to shrink by 45.1%](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-11/card/ukraine-s-economy-to-shrink-by-45-because-of-war-world-bank-says-7ei2iGtBvV2VI2Ibr4ns?mod=article_inline) this year, though the depth of the decline may vary depending on the duration of the war.

“The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine’s economy and it has **inflicted** enormous damage to infrastructure,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank vice president for the Europe and Central Asia region.

## States of Covid Performance

More than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s time to draw some conclusions about government policy and results. The most **comprehensive** **comparative** [study](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/NBERcovidstudy.pdf) we’ve seen to **date** was published last week as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and it deserves wide attention.

The authors are University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan and Stephen Moore and Phil Kerpen of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. They compare Covid outcomes in the 50 states and District of Columbia based on three variables: the economy, education and **mortality**. It’s a revealing study that **belies** much of the **conventional** medical and media wisdom during the pandemic, especially in its first year when severe lockdowns were described as the best, and the only moral, policy.

The nearby table shows the state ranking based on a combined score of the three variables. Utah ranks first by a considerable **margin** over Nebraska and Vermont. The Beehive State scored well across all three categories: fourth on the economy, fifth in education (as measured by lost days in school), and eighth in Covid mortality adjusted for a state population’s age and the **prevalence** of obesity and **diabetes** (leading co-morbidities for Covid deaths). The authors used a **regression** analysis for the economy that adjusted for state industry **composition**.

![img](https://images.wsj.net/im-522057?width=639&height=807)



The top 10 in the rankings are smaller states with the **notable** *exception of Florida*, which ranks sixth. Recall how the Sunshine State’s decision to open itself relatively soon after the first lockdowns was **derided** as cruel and destructive. Gov. Ron DeSantis was called “Governor DeathSentence.”

The study ranks Florida 28th in **mortality**, in the middle off the pack and about the same as California, which ranks 27th despite its far more **stringent** lockdowns and school **closures**. But Florida ranks third for the least education loss and 13th in economic performance. California ranks 47th overall because its shutdowns **crushed** the economy (40th) and in-person school (50th).

In other words, Florida did about average on mortality as other states, but it did far better in protecting its citizens from severe economic harm and its children from lost schooling. “The **correlation** between health and economy scores is essentially zero,” say the authors, “which suggests that states that withdrew the most from economic activity did not significantly improve health by doing so.”

The NBER working paper presents the data straight without policy conclusions, but here’s one of ours: The severe lockdown states suffered much more on **overall** social well-being in return for relatively little **comparative** benefit on health.

The most extreme example of this **tradeoff** is Hawaii, an isolated island state with an economy heavily dependent on tourism. The state came closest of any to **imposing** a version of China’s zero-Covid policy as it shut down travel to the islands. The result was a **stellar** performance on **mortality**—first by a big **margin**. But it finished last in economic performance and 46th in education.

The bottom 10 are **dominated** by states and D.C. that had the most **stringent** lockdowns and were among the last to reopen schools. Their economies are for the most part still behind most others in recovering from the pandemic.

New York, whose former Governor Andrew Cuomo was celebrated as a Covid hero, ranks 49th. Albany’s severe and **overlong** economic shutdown (48th) had no payoff in mortality (47th). New Jersey ranks last with a **miserable** performance across the board. Gov. Phil Murphy didn’t save lives, but he did savage the economy and punish students as he followed the teachers union demands on school **closures** to rank 41st on education.

Another lesson we’d draw that the authors don’t in their paper: Thank the U.S. **Constitution** for our federalist system of government. States were largely able to **implement** their own policies. The outcomes would have been much worse had Washington imposed a single national policy as dictated by the federal bureaucracy.

Let’s hope we absorb the lessons of these state outcomes for how to respond to the next pandemic—and there will be a next one.

## David Mamet Is a **Defiant** Scribe in the Age of **Conformity**

Back in the 1980s and ’90s, **innumerable** films, TV documentaries and history textbooks **instructed** us that the 1950s were years of conformity and **conventionalism**: “The Donna Reed Show,” McCarthyism, “The Organization Man,” TV dinners. In fact, the ’50s were a time of extraordinary **artistic** creativity, **boundless** technological innovation, original thinking in politics, **intellectual** **diversity** in **journalism** and higher education, new energy in religion, and enormous progress in race relations. What the ’80s and ’90s mistook for **conformity** was a naturally evolved cultural **solidarity**—something nearly everybody, on the left and the right, longs for now.

An **informed** observer of present-day America might **reasonably** conclude that our own decade—at least among the educated and advantaged classes—is far more **imbued** with the spirit of **conformism** than the ’50s were. **Corporate** managers and military leaders **parrot** **nostrums** about diversity, inclusion and **sustainability** that few of them believe. Museums and **orchestras** **studiously** avoid programming that might **offend** **ideologues**. Reporters and producers in the mainstream press seize on stories—or ignore them—**solely** because that’s what everybody else in the press is doing. Large majorities in wealthy cities **dutifully** **comply** with public-health restrictions they know to be largely ineffective, mainly because refusing to do so would invite the **ire** of friends and neighbors complying with those restrictions for the same reason.

Maybe America’s deciders and describers (to use Nicholas Eberstadt’s phrase) aren’t the independent-minded lot they think themselves to be.

---

These and related **ironies** were on my mind in February when I received a galley copy of the **playwright** David Mamet’s “**Recessional**: The Death of Free Speech and the Cost of Free Lunch,” published Tuesday. The book is a collection of essays written over the past two years on an array of cultural and political topics: pandemic zealotry, [Donald Trump](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump), terrorism, California’s **punitive** tax code, **Christianity** and **Judaism**, **Broadway** and the movies. The essays are by turns **witty**, **insightful**, affecting and **cryptic**. What struck me most about the book, though, was how **superbly** out of place its author must be in the **eminent** environs of his chosen industry.

In March I visited Mr. Mamet’s home in Santa Monica and asked him about, for lack of a more original term, the Age of Conformity. What is the source of this sudden **impulse** to go along with the crowd that we see at high levels of American society?

“It’s that time-wasting machine,” he says, pointing to the cellphone with which I’m recording the conversation. “We’re all connected. But connected for what purpose? The idea that everybody has to behave the same way is part of the breakdown of what was a **cohesive** society.”

He brings up the 1950s without **prompting**. “When I was a kid,” he says—Mr. Mamet was born in Chicago in 1947—“people went to different churches, they were from different **ethnic** backgrounds, their parents came from different countries, but somehow they managed to have a **collective** life. All of their self-worth didn’t come from belonging and staying connected to this one uber-group.”

Mr. Mamet’s works include the Pulitzer-winning play “Glengarry Glen Ross” (1984) and the screenplays for “The Untouchables” (1987), “Hoffa” (1992) and “Heist” (2001). He speaks the way he writes: in short, forceful sentences and with constant recourse to wild **anecdotes**, **uproarious** jokes and literary **quotations** bent to his purpose.

Do people in the entertainment industry censor themselves? “They do not walk around saying things that are dangerous to express, no. People whisper out here. They have to. To say, ‘Well maybe Trump did some good things’—you can’t do that. You’d risk your home, your job, your family, your friends.”

Mr. Mamet is convinced that the “woke agenda” (his term) is basically an act, so in some ways it works well in Hollywood. “Nobody really believes it,” he says. “Nobody really believes boys turn into girls and girls turn into boys—no one does. But it’s put into a different category, so that it becomes dangerous to question it. If you question it, you’re out.”

Are the young buying it? My own observation suggests some **substantial** minority do not. Academics and college students I’ve spoken to since 2017 **indicate** that social pressure to signal **assent** to a rotating series of **orthodoxies**, from public health to race and gender theories, has sparked a quiet **revolt**. Post a black square on Instagram to show that America is **systemically** racist, even if you don’t think that’s true; wear a mask even though you know it doesn’t work and you’re 20 and vaccinated; share your pronouns whether you accept or reject gender **ideology**—a reaction seems almost guaranteed.

“People of that generation,” Mr. Mamet agrees, “a lot of them just aren’t scared anymore.”

Not that he expects anybody among our **institutional** leaders to admit they were wrong, on Covid or crime or anything else. He mentions Stacy Schiff’s “Witches,” a 2015 history of the Salem **trials**. “The **delusion** ran for about 18 months,” Mr. Mamet says, summarizing the book, “and after that, since they couldn’t explain it, they just forgot it. It never happened.” The phenomenon by which authorities and experts make a **hash** of things and then move on as if nothing happened is one attentive readers will recognize. Mr. Mamet offers some encouragement. “The thing about history,” he says, “is not that people change. People don’t change. But people die. So a new generation comes up and says, ‘Yeah, I get it, that’s stupid, I’m not gonna do that.’ ”

As if to **demonstrate** **noncompliance**, one of Mr. Mamet’s **poodles**, Ruby, jumps on the couch and sniffs my face. “Manners!” he shouts. “Come on, you’re embarrassing me in front of my guest. Sit!” The dog pays little attention. Made at last to submit, Ruby reluctantly goes elsewhere.

On the coffee table between us are several books by and about James Joyce, and an **oversized** edition of the Torah. “It’s all there,” Mr. Mamet says, pointing to the holy book. “Everything we’ve been living through.” The habit among America’s wealthy, **privileged** influencers of **reviling** the country that gave them privilege and influence, Mr. Mamet says, is in various way a re-**enactment** of **biblical** events. He refers to the **narrative** in which God provides manna for the Israelites in the **wilderness**: “The people are hungry, there’s nothing to eat in the desert, so God says, I’ll give ’em manna. They say, What does manna taste like? Answer: It tastes like whatever your favorite food is. They say, I don’t *want* whatever my favorite food is. And so they stage another **rebellion**.”

That is a heavily **abridged** version of the accounts in **Exodus** and Numbers, but he is right about the biblical pattern: **Prosperity**, particularly **unearned** **prosperity**, tends to **generate** folly and vice. “When do violent revolutions happen?” he asks. “They happen when things get too good.” We live in the “most **prosperous** country in the history of the world, and so what’s our response?” Mr. Mamet waits for me to answer, but I keep silent. “The response is: We don’t need God. We don’t need the Constitution. We don’t need anything. Go study **semiotics**. Go become an energy **therapist**, whatever. Someone will take care of you and tell you what to do.”

Mr. Mamet announced a turn to the political right in a 2008 [essay](https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/03/11/david-mamet-why-i-am-no-longer-a-brain-dead-liberal/) for the Village Voice, “Why I Am No Longer a ‘Brain-Dead **Liberal**,’ ” but he was a black sheep long before then. His 1992 play “Oleanna,” for instance, features a male academic whose life and career are ruined by a calculating female student’s **spurious** **accusation** of sexual **harassment**.

Was there a moment when he decided to break ranks altogether? “I met a guy at my **synagogue** here maybe 20 years ago,” he says. “He was talking about Milton Friedman and [Friedrich] Hayek and Thomas Sowell. It didn’t make any sense to me, but I was impressed by his attitude. He wasn’t **strident** or **arrogant**. It was that guy’s attitude that impressed me.”

The man lent Mr. Mamet some books by these authors. “I said to him, ‘Good, I’ll read them. But,’ I said, ‘when my friends come over, I’ll have to hide them.’ He said: ‘I don’t.’ And that changed my life. What was I saying? Did I really think I had to hide books from my friends? How sick was I? It was a Road to Damascus moment.”

(Mr. Mamet, an **observant** Jew, freely uses Christian **imagery**, as in this reference to the Apostle Paul’s **conversion**. In “Recessional” he remarks, **apropos** of Billy Graham’s **oratory**, that he “would be thrilled to accept the Christian tradition and Christ as my Savior” but that “I am **prohibited** from doing so by my own religion.” Here, at least, he conforms.)

He recalls another **incident** around the same time, not long after he bought his house in Santa Monica. The house was, and still is, surrounded by enormous **hedges**—you can hardly see the building from the nearby street. He received a letter from the City Council demanding that he cut the hedges down to a certain height or be fined $25,000 for every day the hedges remained too high. He eventually won that **wrangle**, he recalls, but the episode led him to believe that many government officials simply enjoy forcing law-**abiding** people into **compliance** with **arbitrary** **dictates**.

“I thought at the time: I’ve seen these people before.” The “**hedge** **commissioners**,” as he calls them, were the theater **critics** he’d known earlier in his career. “They would come in on opening night and **strut** around and stand with their backs to the stage, looking at the people coming in. People used to say, and maybe they still do, that the critics just liked having the power to shut the play down. And the critics would say, ‘No, ha ha, we don’t have that power.’ But they did have it, and they loved it.”

Like many people who find themselves **dissenting** from the **dominant** **outlook** of their **cultivated** and post-religious **peers**, Mr. Mamet felt that modern **conceptions** of human nature had become hopelessly naive. A **rosy** view of human **proclivities** leads easily to groupthink and its **invariable** **accompaniment**, **scapegoating**. Since the existence of evil is undeniable, if it isn’t **intrinsic** to all of us, it must come from some **disfavored** person or group.

Which led him back to **biblical** religion. “The Bible starts with **perfidy**, and perfidy is everywhere in it. There are very few people in the Bible you want your kids to be like,” he says. We exchange our favorite bits of biblical **realism**. Mr. Mamet notes that the **genealogies** of David and other heroes don’t bother skipping over—indeed they seem to go out of their way to mention—**adulterers**. “What the Bible is telling us is that the human race is **unalterably** **flawed**. It’s not a matter of doing away with the ‘haters’ or with this group or that group. We have to deal with our own mind.”

A **robust** understanding of your own and others’ **propensity** to bad behavior, he seems to suggest, has a way of **inoculating** you against groupthink.

Woke signaling, blind compliance with public-health authoritarianism, **deference** to theater critics and **tyrannical** city officials—Mr. Mamet doesn’t play along. I’m reminded of the line spoken by Richard Roma, the aggressive and highly successful real-**estate** salesman in “Glengarry Glen Ross” played by Al Pacino in the 1992 film **adaptation**. “I subscribe to the law of contrary public opinion,” Roma says. “If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way.”
