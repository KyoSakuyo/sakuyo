 Helpfulness allows a kid to have a group of friends around him.

###### 驳论——Being honest

Surely, some skeptics may argue that being honest is the most important virtue for parents to share with a young kid, but the truth is that , being honest will pose a invisible threat to kids.

 This is because, absolute honesty will hurt others. Having such a honesty takes a huge risk. When you show your everything true to him, it also means that the other are forced to take the obligates of hearing from  you. Maybe you had not noticed it, they just force their friends to sphere their emotion or make a feedback. Some time later, when their friends feel such a stress from his or her best friend, they may will just give up keeping contact with them. 

Thus, keeping something not so honest in the relationship of kids will pose a positive influence to them.

Surely, some skeptics may argue that being honest is the most important virtue for parents to share with a young kid since honesty could help kid gain trust from their friends, teachers and teachers are able to build up a reliable personal image. However, the truth is that the honesty of young kids might be taken advantage of by some villains. To be more specific, they may ask kids questions like where their home is located, *careers of their parents, whether their family rich or not,* **换成从句** and when there is no one at home. If kids answer all of these questions honestly, it could help villains find appropriate chance of burglary. 

Thus, teaching kids to be honest all the time may put them in danger.
