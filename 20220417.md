# California’s French Four-Day Workweek

The popular book “The 4-Hour Workweek” provides tips on how to make more money by working less. Now California Democrats are taking a page from the book by proposing to **mandate** a four-day week, which would require businesses to pay employees the same wages for less work. As labor economics goes, this is up there with paying people not to work and expecting more people to work.

A bill moving through the **Legislature** would shorten California’s normal workweek to 32 hours from 40 for companies with more than 500 employees. Workers who put in more than 32 hours in a week would have to be paid time-and-a-half. And get this: Employers would be prohibited from reducing workers’ current pay rate, so they would be paid the same for working 20% less.

Democrats say a shorter workweek will help businesses **retain** burned-out workers and increase productivity and profits. “There has been no **correlation** between working more hours and better productivity,” Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia says. Do Democrats really think [Tesla](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA) workers can **assemble** as many cars in 32 hours as they do in 40?

Many employers, especially in **white-collar** **professions**, have begun to offer flexible hours and work arrangements. Some have noticed **diminishing** returns on labor **output** **whereby** workers after a certain point produce less the longer they work. If companies think reducing hours will improve employee **morale**, productivity and profits, they will do it.

Liberals cite [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT)’s experiment with a four-day workweek in Japan, which reportedly improved productivity by 40%. But Microsoft also made other changes to boost productivity, including shorter meetings. (The next **mandate**: No more than two zoom calls a day!) A four-day week might work for tech companies, but it probably won’t for most businesses. Got a medical emergency? Sorry, Friday is the new Saturday at hospitals.

Employers have fixed costs in training and **overhead**, so reducing work hours raises the **marginal** cost of each worker. A 32-hour week means employers will have to hire more employees at a higher overall cost to do the same amount of work. Or they’ll have to pay overtime. Or they’ll simply do less business. Most companies will pass on increased costs to customers, including Americans in other states. Workers will have more **leisure** but at the cost of less efficiency and a lower standard of living.

As is often the case with bad economic ideas, France **enshrined** a 35-hour workweek in 2000. The thinking was that by forcing everyone to work less, more people would be hired. But it hasn’t turned out that way, as French unemployment remains high. Most advanced economies have a 40-hour workweek. The U.K. doesn’t even have a legal limit.

Supporters say the 32-hour workweek is no big deal because it would apply only to employers with more than 500 workers. But those companies employ more than half of California’s workers, and small businesses they **contract** with could eventually be swept in under the state’s joint-employer **doctrine**.

While the bill may not pass immediately, California is an **incubator** of progressive ideas that are often taken up by Democrats elsewhere. Single-payer healthcare, a millionaire’s tax, and climate cap and trade all started in Sacramento. And sure enough, California Rep. Mark Takano has already introduced a bill to **mandate** a 32-hour workweek nationwide.

Why do progressives think any idea they come up with has to be imposed by political **coercion**? You know the answer. Because they believe in their **superior** moral virtue, and they like to **order** other people around.

# The Eternal Covid Emergency

The Covid emergency is over thanks mainly to vaccines and **therapies**. Yet Health and Human Service s Secretary Xavier Becerra on Wednesday extended the national public-health emergency for another 90 days. Why? Because permanent crisis means more dependence on government.

The Trump Administration **invoked** the emergency under the Public Health Service Act on Jan. 31, 2020 to reduce **red tape** for healthcare providers. But then Congress linked an **expansion** of **Medicaid** and **food stamps** to the **declaration**. Now progressives don’t want the emergency to end.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act of March 2020 **suspended** food-stamp work requirements for **able-bodied** adults without dependents during the emergency. These individuals normally can’t receive benefits for more than three months over a three-year period unless they work or participate in a work-training program. Congress also boosted benefits, so the average monthly payment is now double ($240 per person) what it was in 2019.

Suspending work requirements was intended to help workers laid off during lockdowns when few jobs were available. But once lockdowns eased, businesses were desperate to hire. The **sweetened** food stamps and suspended work-requirement—on top of enhanced unemployment benefits and other transfer payments—reduced the **incentive** to return to work.

Now there are 1.8 job **openings** for every unemployed worker, and the unemployment rate has fallen to near pre-pandemic levels. Yet as of January there were nearly 2.5 million more **households** receiving food stamps than in 2019 and 500,000 more than in April 2020. What’s wrong with this picture?

States may end the **supplemental** food stamps before the public-health emergency is **lifted**, but only a dozen or so have. Even GOP governors struggle to resist free **federal** money, and they **fret** about being attacked for refusing extra benefits amid rising food costs, even if **beneficiaries** aren’t poor.

Congress also increased Medicaid funding for states during the emergency on the condition they don’t remove beneficiaries from their rolls, even if they earn too much to **qualify**. Medicaid **enrollment** has **swelled** by more than 14.6 million (20%) since February 2020—more than gained coverage from [ObamaCare](https://www.macpac.gov/subtopic/medicaid-enrollment-changes-following-the-aca/).

A recent Journal of the American Medical Association study found that Wisconsin Medicaid enrollment increased 11.1% more than would be expected based on economic factors during the first seven months of the emergency, mostly because **ineligible** beneficiaries weren’t kicked off. Some states now want to **prune** their rolls but can’t without losing federal funds. Congress has hooked states on federal transfer payments, and Democrats want them to stay hooked.

The emergency rules have served some useful purposes, such as letting Medicare cover **telehealth** services and waiving a Medicare requirement that beneficiaries be **hospitalized** for three days before the cost of nursing-home care is covered. But the Administration can make some of those useful changes permanent by regulation and ask Congress to include those it can’t in the **mooted** Covid spending bill.

The same bill is also a chance to override Mr. Becerra’s **declaration** of what is becoming an eternal Covid emergency. Pandemic welfare shouldn’t become **endemic**.

# Why the Ukraine War Hasn’t Crashed the Stock Market

To **paraphrase** [JP Morgan](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JPM) banker Jamie Dimon’s advice to investors and **analysts** this week, everything looks pretty good except the possibility that something really bad could happen.

The stock market, so far, has largely **recapitulated** its pattern from past wars: sell the rumor, buy the news. The S&P 500 hit a recent low on Feb. 23, the day before Russia’s invasion. It’s up 167 points since then.

A Canadian fund manager made news by advising his investors to keep buying stocks because in an **all-out** nuclear war their **portfolio allocation** would be **irrelevant** anyway. Looking back and trying to explain a **modest** 7% drop during the Cuban missile crisis, economists reached for a [similar](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=421000089122084066067089119093098031057007068045058024089020081126083019086085016010033060122005052003049114069017002092106087112008078077085085090023106065064108124000078053120075087124116126005003088117065070070068100106001015092103123090100088116114&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) explanation: There’s no point discounting a worst-case outcome because nobody will be around to benefit from a wise investment decision.

Fritz Todt, who built the **autobahn**, told Hitler in November 1941 the war could not be won and must be ended **politically**. Hitler responded: “I can **scarcely** still see a way of coming politically to an end.”

The **führer** was talking his book. Negotiated endings are always on the cards, as they now could be for Vladimir Putin. There was no “**existential**” risk for Germany. Even under the **rigorous** **terms** actually imposed—unconditional **surrender**—Germany survived and quickly was on its way to becoming the leading state in Europe. The “existential” risk belonged to Hitler; under any settlement that might be **envisaged**, he would have had to leave power and accept **accountability** for his crimes.

Mr. Putin, in **astonishingly** **short order**, has turned his Ukraine **lark** into a similar risk not for Russia but for Mr. Putin. **Hence** a heating up of the **rhetoric** recently. RIA Novosti, an official Moscow news service, issued a **bloodcurdling** [call](https://ccl.org.ua/en/news/ria-novosti-has-clarified-russias-plans-vis-a-vis-ukraine-and-the-rest-of-the-free-world-in-a-program-like-article-what-russia-should-do-with-ukraine-2/) for the **liquidation** of Ukraine. Sergey Karaganov, a leading Putin **intellectual**, [told](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/04/russia-cannot-afford-to-lose-so-we-need-a-kind-of-a-victory-sergey-karaganov-on-what-putin-wants) a Western interviewer, “The **stakes** of the Russian elite are very high—for them it is an existential war,” and gave voice to a miracle scenario in which nuclear threats cause the U.S. to abandon NATO.

And despite Washington having supplied Ukraine’s military for years, a **démarche** this week from the Russian Embassy demands the U.S. stop and warns of “**unpredictable** consequences.”

I first [mentioned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303563304579447330204327484?mod=article_inline) the Hitler-Todt episode in this **column** in 2014, in **anticipation** of Mr. Putin bringing the world to such moment. It is difficult not to imagine him now fingering his weapons of mass **destruction**, particularly his **tactical** nuclear **warheads**, and wondering if they might offer a way out of his dilemma—a concern publicly **aired** this week by CIA Director William Burns.

Only one answer would seem to fit the situation: a clear signal to Mr. Putin that, in such a case, NATO airpower will join the war on Ukraine’s side and reduce most of his standing army to a **smoldering** **wreck**. Where the **decisive** ground battle is now shaping up in eastern Ukraine, the open **terrain** is especially **conducive** to such an **aerial** **campaign**.

The logic of **preserving** his army to fight another day will be hard for Mr. Putin to ignore if he hopes to stay in his job. Seven weeks of war have also been useful: He and his **domestic** allies have had a chance to **wrap** their heads around the possibility of defeat. For his colleagues, moreover, an easy decision is not to see everything they value destroyed for the **sake** of a man they’ve come to **loathe** personally.

One way or another, the U.S. is likely to find itself moving closer to center stage in the conflict and its endgame. Germany and others resist cutting Mr. Putin’s **vital** energy dollars not just out of concern for their own economies; they don’t **crave** the risks and **uncertainties** that come with making Mr. Putin’s position in Moscow **terminally** **untenable**. Probably Mr. Biden’s advisers, except a few **militants**, agree. And if anything can get China’s Xi Jinping off the **sidelines** and working with the U.S. and Europe in Ukraine, it will be a desire not to see Mr. Putin **humiliated**.

Only the Ukrainians themselves, having experienced Russian occupation and seen that it means **acquiescing** in the mass murder of civilians, are a likely voice of realism and **spine-stiffening.** Lately recalled have been JFK’s words about the necessity of leaving Khrushchev an exit route. In Mr. Putin’s case, the advice is too late. With his **blunders** and **miscalculations**, his survival is now in his own hands; he has left the allies nothing to work with. [Joe Biden](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/joe-biden)’s **alleged** **rhetorical** **excesses** may be all that—calling Mr. Putin a war criminal, referring to **genocide** (not an unreasonable **interpretation** of recent Russian **rhetoric**), saying Mr. Putin should not remain in power.

My guess is these out-of-school **expostulations** pop out for a reason—because the **consensus** after so many hours of White House discussion is that Mr. Putin is likely beyond saving no matter what the U.S. does.
