# Russian Missiles Strike Ukrainian Military Training Base Near Polish Border

A Russian airstrike on a Ukrainian military training center close to the Polish border threw into sharp relief the hazards of the Western push to deliver arms support to Kyiv while avoiding direct conflict with a nuclear **adversary**.

The airstrike killed 35 people at the facility in Yavoriv about 10 miles from the Polish border early Sunday, far to the west of where the conflict has been concentrated, one day after Moscow warned the West that it would consider arms deliveries to Ukraine as **legitimate** targets.

A large **portion** of the military aid from the West—[one of the largest transfers of arms in history](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nato-members-mount-huge-operation-to-resupply-ukrainian-fighters-11646761821?mod=article_inline)—passes through Poland into western Ukraine, part of the fine line the U.S. and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, allies are walking between aiding Ukraine militarily while **steering** clear of providing troops or enforcing a no-fly zone that Ukraine has called for.

The expansion of Russia’s **aggression** to a target close to Poland also increases the risk of the war **encroaching** on [NATO **territory**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-nato-russia-ukraine-which-countries-members-no-fly-article-5-11646236897?mod=article_inline), which the U.S. has warned would be treated as an attack on the alliance. Any strike on Poland would bring “the full force of the NATO alliance to bear in responding to it,” Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in an interview Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said more attacks aimed at supply lines and foreign **mercenaries** supporting Ukraine were in the offing.

**Armaments** supplied to Ukraine by the U.S. and its European allies—especially antitank and antiaircraft weapons—have played an important role in checking [the advance of Russian ground troops](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-11?mod=article_inline), who have suffered heavy **casualties** in the north as they [have tried to encircle the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-strikes-intensify-near-kyiv-as-ukraines-president-foresees-new-stage-of-terror-11647080618?mod=article_inline).

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that military aid alone might not be enough to enable Ukraine to fight off [Russia’s invasion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-russia-war-invasion-whats-happening-11646157211?mod=article_inline), and has made increasingly urgent calls for a no-fly zone that would protect the supplies entering the country and [the refugees fleeing to neighboring countries](https://www.wsj.com/articles/waves-of-ukrainian-refugees-overwhelm-poland-11646856187?mod=article_inline).

The U.S. and its European allies have said a no-fly zone that involved other countries’ air forces risks **escalating** the conflict because it would only be effective if it were **empowered** to deter Russian planes. The U.S. also last week **declined** to support a Polish plan to give the U.S. [Soviet-built MiG-29 combat jets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/poland-to-make-mig-29-combat-jetsavailable-to-u-s-11646767232?mod=article_inline) after the U.S. had **broached** the **prospect** of Poland supplying the planes directly to Ukraine.

While the West aids Ukraine, Russia has asked China for military equipment and other assistance for its war effort, according to U.S. officials, who didn’t **specify** what Russia had requested.

News of Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s request for help from Beijing, first reported by the Washington Post, comes as Mr. Sullivan heads to Rome on Monday to meet with a top Chinese official to discuss Ukraine.

Mr. Sullivan spoke on CNN on Sunday of the growing concern inside the Biden administration that Russia might be looking for help in the conflict, though he didn’t acknowledge a specific request from Russia to China.

“We are also watching closely to see the **extent** to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support, to Russia,” Mr. Sullivan said. “It is a concern of ours, and we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to **compensate** Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions.”

In addition to supplying arms, the Biden administration and its allies have shared intelligence with Kyiv and **inflicted** [sweeping economic sanctions ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-sanctions-11645819467?mod=article_inline)against Russia. But they are facing calls from some **quarters** to do more.

A **Republican** **senator** on Sunday said the Biden administration shouldn’t necessarily let the prospect of the U.S. entering direct combat with Russia stop it from sending more assistance to Ukraine.

“You always have to keep in mind that you don’t want to **escalate** to a direct **confrontation** with Russia,” Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the **Senate** Foreign Relations Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday.” But he added: “I wouldn’t call it World War Three. I think if the thing did get away there, I think it would end pretty quickly because with the **conventional** forces that [Russia has] had there, you know, we haven’t seen this kind of **ineptness** in a long, long time.”

Moscow has been closely following the **tenor** of the discussions over how much assistance the West should provide Ukraine, with state-run media noting last week that Poland had become a supply hub for Western military aid flowing into Ukraine—a fact the West had **trumpeted** until recently.

NATO allies openly publicized their first shipments, with some sharing news of their deliveries on [Facebook](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FB) and [Twitter](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TWTR).

Allies have since become more **discreet**, although the **furious** pace of deliveries has continued. At least seven military cargo jets from NATO allies landed on Saturday alone at the **provincial** airport of Rzeszow, in southern Poland.

Sunday’s strike on the military training facility comes as Moscow has shown off its ability to bomb [targets throughout Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-maps-russia-war-11647035750?mod=article_inline). Ukraine’s military said at a **briefing** Sunday that a Russian bomber, based in the Russian city of Saratov, launched the rockets from over the Black Sea.

Ukrainian antiaircraft missile batteries destroyed most of the rockets, but eight reached their target at the Yavoriv military base, Ukraine’s military said. Survivors of the attack said the Russian rockets targeted **barracks**.

For years, the military base in Yavoriv hosted **maneuvers** involving live small-arms fire, tanks, artillery, air defense and combat helicopters. The U.S. and other countries [have **instructed** the Ukrainian military there](https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-national-guard-trained-ukraines-military-for-decadesand-now-it-helps-from-afar-11647010800?mod=article_inline) on NATO weapons and standards; troops from the Florida National Guard left last month.

Ambulances carried the wounded to the nearby city of Novoyavorivsk, where doctors **triaged** **dazed** men.

“I heard the first flash, the second, the third,” said a soldier who gave his name as Oleksandr and was treated at a Novoyavorivsk hospital. “Everyone was asleep. We didn’t hear any sirens.”

Several said the strikes concentrated on living quarters. “They hit exactly where the **manpower** was, exactly where we were,” said a man who gave his name as Volodymyr, as he smoked a cigarette through a gap in the bandages on his face.

When an air **raid** sounded, doctors aided the wounded in a darkened hospital **cellar**, where several women **clutched** newborns and prayed in **unison** to the Virgin Mary.

On high **alert** after the strike, **militiamen** at an armed checkpoint west of the training center laid a chain of **spikes** across the road.

Russia’s Defense Department claimed its strike on the facility in Yavoriv killed as many as 180 foreign **mercenaries**, a figure that couldn’t be confirmed. “The destruction of foreign mercenaries on the territory of Ukraine will continue,” the Defense Department added.

A Ukrainian military spokesman said there were no foreigners among the dead or wounded at the base, as did the Yavoriv mayor’s office. Doctors at the hospital treating the wounded said there were no foreigners among them.

The Yavoriv military base targeted by Russia sits near a **thoroughfare** between Poland and [Lviv, a city in western Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-ukrainian-city-prepares-for-battle-far-from-the-front-line-11646398522?mod=article_inline) that has been serving as a **logistical** hub.

Missiles also hit an airport near the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine on Sunday morning, the third attack on the city since the invasion began, the mayor said.

# Does the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill Say That?

**Opponents** call it Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill, and the political **branding** seems to have worked, given how the **mainstream** press **laundered** that charged phrase into a national **rallying** cry. The **legislation** passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday, and it now awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis’s signature.

What does the [seven-page bill](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/er/PDF) actually do? One section says schools generally “may not discourage or prohibit parental notification of and involvement in **critical** decisions affecting a student’s mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being.” Parents also can’t be blocked from “education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school.”

Another section says: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual **orientation** or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a **manner** that is not age-appropriate.” Parents who think the law isn’t being followed could ask for the appointment of a **magistrate** to review the **dispute**. Or they could **sue** to get a **declaratory** judgment and **attorney** fees.

To millions of parents, this no doubt sounds **noncontroversial**. Their children’s mental health and school records are **eminently** their business. Kindergartners are supposed to be learning how to read and **peaceably** **resolve** **turf** wars over Tonka trucks. To their tiny ears, “sexual orientation” is a string of silly nonsense **syllables**. The bill says older children could be taught “age-appropriate” material.

Moreover, the curriculum rule would appear to have [no immediate effect](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/03/08/whats-ahead-for-florida-students-parents-after-passage-of-dont-say-gay-bill/). “In practice,” the Tampa Bay Times reports, “it is unclear exactly how things will change in the classroom because sexual orientation and gender identity is not something that is being taught in grades K-3 at the moment.” If that’s the case, then why is everybody so **riled** up?

Earlier versions of the bill said that primary schools could not “encourage classroom discussion” about sexual orientation. **Critics** said this was **vague**. What if a teacher asked students to draw and describe their families, and one had two moms? Last month the House **revised** its bill to target “classroom instruction,” a **narrower** phrase. “The idea that we would ban a specific conversation a child is having about their parent is impossible,” [the **legislative** sponsor said](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/02/17/republicans-made-changes-to-dont-say-gay-bill-lgbtq-advocates-arent-buying-it/).

Yet the **narrative** train was speeding down the track already. Some reporters this week are still **blithely** quoting the wrong version of the bill. A Democratic lawmaker [**invokes** “1984” and claims](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2022/03/08/what-the-dont-say-gay-bill-gets-wrong-about-florida-classrooms-and-kids-column/): “Not only might teachers be punished for allowing classroom discussion about a student’s own family structure, but children with LGBTQ+ family members will be **ostracized** and shamed.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed that maybe the bill’s sponsors want to hurt children. “Why are Florida leaders deciding they need to **discriminate** against kids who are members of the LGBTQI community?” [she said.](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1501877515115278341) “Is it **meanness**? Is it wanting to make kids have more difficult times in school?” [Disney](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS)’s CEO was buffaloed into taking a public **stance** against the legislation, which satisfied no one.

None of this **criticism** is true. The legislation is a response to public-school educators who think parents should stay out of school decisions. But parents have a right to ensure that the curriculum is age appropriate, and that it is focused on learning instead of promoting someone’s cultural agenda. The bill lets them **vindicate** parental authority.

The bigger lesson is that even modest **conservative** **pushback** on cultural issues will be met by a firestorm. The **overwrought** reaction shows why the bill passed.
