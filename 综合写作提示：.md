The reading passage explores three solutions to the fungus problems of golden frogs. Firstly, some scientists suggest that the colonies of bacterium which produce chemicals to kill fungus, could be introduced to the skin of golden frogs.

The second solution is breed frogs in disease-free captivity, and later on when frogs grow up, they could be released into the wild.

The last way is to spread the natural defense, by which frogs could heat up their body and slow down the growth of fungus, among golden frogs.

###### **It does not work: Temporary/doesn't last long.**

+ Bacterium only produce chemicals early in their colonization, but later on they stop producing these substances and thus stop protecting golden frogs.

+ Other animals in the wild also carry this kind of fungus.

A little over 2,200 years ago, the Roman navy attacked the Greek port city of Syracuse. According to some ancient historians, the Greeks defended themselves with an ingenious weapon called a “burning mirror”: a polished copper surface curved to focus the Sun’s rays onto Roman ships, causing them to catch fire. However, we have several reasons to suspect that the story of the burning mirror is just a myth and the Greeks of Syracuse never really built such a device.

First, the ancient Greeks were not technologically advanced enough to make such a device. A mirror that would focus sunlight with sufficient intensity to set ships on fire would have to be several meters wide. Moreover, the mirror would have to have a very precise parabolic curvature (a curvature derived from a geometric shape known as the parabola). The technology for manufacturing a large sheet of copper with such specifications did not exist in the ancient world.

Second, the burning mirror would have taken a long time to set the ships on fire. In an experiment conducted to determine whether a burning mirror was feasible, a device concentrating the Sun’s rays on a wooden object 30 meters away took ten minutes to set the object on fire; and during that time, the object had to be unmoving. It is unlikely that the Roman ships stayed perfectly still for that much time. Such a weapon would therefore have been very impractical and ineffective.

Third, a burning mirror does not seem like an improvement on a weapon that the Greeks already had: flaming arrows. Shooting at an enemy’s ships with flaming arrows was a common way of setting the ships on fire. The burning mirror and flaming arrows would have been effective at about the same distance. So the Greeks had no reason to build a weapon like a burning mirror.

The reading passage explores that when Greek soliders were attacked by Romans, did they defende themselves by burning mirrors, and the professor's lecture deals with the same issue. However, she thinks that passage's statements are not convincng. In the lecture, she uses three specific points to support his idea.

Firstly, even though the reading passage suggests that Greeks lacked enough technology to make mirrors can focus sufficient sunlight, the professor suggests that it is not all true. This is because although a single mirror did cannot deal with such a huge work, Greeks will arrange a sheet of mirrors to help them focus.

However, contrary to the statement in the reading that it would take too much time to set fire on the boats made of woods, the professor contends that the boats are not all made from wood. Maybe there will be some waterproof materials which could be set fire in a flash added to the boat. It is just a quick enough methord.

Finally, the author of the reading claims that burning mirrors are not worked as a improvement of the original weapon, flaming arrows. They have same functions and they even work in a same distance. The professor proves that this claim is indefensible by pointing out that Roman soilders are familiar with flaming arrows so that they just have a methrd to defend the arrows and put them off. But using the mirrors which are exactly invisible, will definitely make a difficult to the Romans.
